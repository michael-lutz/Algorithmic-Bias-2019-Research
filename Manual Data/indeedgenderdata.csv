Movielabs -  San Francisco, CA
2012 to Present
Software engineer for the movie industry.  
  
• Created metadata collection systems for the movie industry. The metadata is divided between title (movies, TV, videos), and website data (known and suspected piracy sites).  
  
• These data collections are used internally within the movie industry (production studios, MPAA, EIDR).  
  
• Examples of title metadata are titles, release dates, cast and crew, theatrical revenue, etc. The data is provided by source (proprietary data from studios, the MPAA, and publicly available data). Data is matched across sources into single data sets per title.  
  
• The website (piracy) metadata includes website ip addresses, country of operation, country level download information and some media title level information.  
  
• Each collection system has an internal Java api. The data is stored in MySQL and the api's are built off of custom JDBC query builders (which was later converted to Hibernate/JPA).  
  
• The internal api's are used by various services:  
◦ A Swagger/Spring web api for general data access. The api has 2 basic modes - query and data retrieval. The query mode returns titles ids for a query request (by release dates, genre, theatrical revenue, title updated since, etc.). The data retrieval mode returns a customizable requested data set for a group of title ids.  
◦ A Quartz service for scheduled maintenance (source updates). These updates run on schedules matching the update frequencies of the individual sources.  
◦ A service to drive EIDR updates. This service is an extension of a source update. EIDR is a sister project within Movielabs. In addition to taking metadata from EIDR the update sends data along with a conflict report back to EIDR. 
◦ A Node.js/Mongoose service to export title data to MongoDb.  
◦ Javascript web pages to visualize the data and for some administration. The pages feature charting using NVD3 and grids using agGrid and Slickgrid.

Coursera - Machine Learning

https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/2LR4CNBTNQNF  
  
Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed. In the past decade, machine learning has given us self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search, and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome. Machine learning is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without knowing it. Many researchers also think it is the best way to make progress towards human-level AI. In this class, you will learn about the most effective machine learning techniques, and gain practice implementing them and geting them to work for yourself. More importantly, you'll learn about not only the theoretical underpinnings of learning, but also gain the practical know-how needed to quickly and powerfully apply these techniques to new problems. Finally, you'll learn about some of Silicon Valley's best practices in innovation as it pertains to machine learning and AI.  
  
This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: (i) Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks). (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). (iii) Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI). The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications, so that you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas.

Object Based reasoning in Visual question answering
https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.09718
2018-03
Visual Question Answering (VQA) is a novel problem domain where multi-modal inputs must be processed in order to solve the task given in the form of a natural language. As the solutions inherently require to combine visual and natural language processing with abstract reasoning, the problem is considered as AI-complete. Recent advances indicate that using high-level, abstract facts extracted from the inputs might facilitate reasoning. Following that direction we decided to develop a solution combining state-of-the-art object detection and reasoning modules. The results, achieved on the well-balanced CLEVR dataset, confirm the promises and show significant, few percent improvements of accuracy on the complex ""counting"" task.

Our primary care practice can be a busy, fast-paced environment, and she has shown herself to be reliable in carrying out her duties efficiently and with a positive attitude. I appreciate her curiosity in understanding clinical care, as well as her willingness to learn and improve in performance. Among the staff, Adriana is known to be courteous and helpful to other team members. Significantly, she is well-liked by our patients; feedback from our recent patient satisfaction surveys indicated that patients appreciated her cordial and warm demeanor.

I have been a stay at home mom with my 4 and 5 year old boys for the past 4 years. My boys will be starting Pre K and Kindergarten this August, so that is why I am now available to work again. I do not have any job experience in the past 3 years, except occasionally working as a office admin and working on invoices for my family’s business, but nothing full time (just as needed). I know I may have not been working in the medical field over the past few years, but I know I can get back into the swing of things quickly. I have been home with two young boys and I will say from all the injuries and sicknesses we have dealt with, it did give me some major hands on experience. I am a very determined person and a very quick learner, I know I would excel at any opportunity that was given to me.

Dear Ms. Facility  
I am currently seeking a job position as a Certified Nurse Assistant. On November 2013 I completed my Nursing assistant program at VIP Nursing School, Inc. I am a strong candidate for this job because I am highly skilled in performing all types of patient care activities which include: dressing, bathing, toileting, feeding, special hygiene, moving patients to and from bed and wheelchairs, and assisting in rehabilitative exercises. I am also able to take and document vital signs, weights, intake and output as delegated per facility protocols. In addition, I have a demonstrated ability to prepare and serve meals, assist patients with eating and accompany patients on appointments and visits.  
  
I consider myself a very hard worker who is punctual, team player, organized, professional, and very helpful with patients. I decided to become a Certified Nurse Assistant because as a CNA I truly help others. I have the patience and compassion to work with elders and kids.  
I would like to meet you regarding a job position interview. I can be reached via e-mail angeles.med8989@gmail.com or phone (510 697-3996. Thank you for taking time from your busy schedule. Looking forward to hearing from you.
